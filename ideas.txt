TODO
1. Decide which fields to keep in the happiness data
2. Determine what were testing for
    - How happiness relates to life expectancy and what factors contribute the most to national happiness?
3. Only consider life expectancy data and not the healthy life expectancy from the happiness report dataset since they used extrapolation and interpolation to find some of the data it might not be as accurate.
