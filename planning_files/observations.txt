Data Imputation 
    1. After imputing and predicting values using linear regression, I noticed some parts of the column for corruption of government are still blank
        - Notably, there is not data on how corrupt people think the government is for these countries:
            >> China
            >> Cuba
            >> Maldives
            >> Oman
            >> Turkmenistan

More Rank Data
    1. There is a future problem that the behavior of Series.idxmin or Series.idxmax with all NA values will be deprecated and in future versions will raise a ValueError.
        - Because some countries are missing all their data in one feature the whole feature data is null which is a problem. One solution is to pass .idxmax(skipna=True) however this will not allow us to put a NaN value for that year which is needed.

Changes in continents data:
    - Burkina -> Burkina Faso
    - Added Eswatini 
    - Changed Burma -> Myanmar
    - Added North Macedonia
    - Change column name country to country name
